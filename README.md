## 💁 Project Structure
The project follows a clean and organized structure:

```
 taskly/  
 │── public/             # Static assets  
 │   └── favicon.ico     # Favicon  
 │  
 │── src/                # Source files  
 │   ├── js/             # JavaScript files  
 │   │   ├── main.js     # Main JS file  
 │   │   ├── app.js      # Core task logic  
 │   │   └── utils.js    # Utility functions  
 │   │  
 │   └── css/            # Stylesheets  
 │       └── styles.css  # Main CSS file  
 │  
 │── index.html          # Entry point  
 │── package.json        # Project dependencies  
 │── README.md           # Project documentation  
```

This structure keeps **JavaScript** and **CSS** files organized inside the `src/` folder while **static assets** like the favicon remain in the `public/` folder.
